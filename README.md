# MNIST Neural Network (WIP)
A trained neural network that identifies handwritten digits. For more details on how the model works and some of the methods I incorporated, feel free to checkout the jupyter notebook file in this repository!

## Description
- Neural network that identifies grey-scaled, 28 pixel x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits. 
- Using the MNIST data set for training and validation.

## General Information
- The training and testing csv files were downloaded from [[Kaggle]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) 
- Model accuracy on validation is around 96%
- 1 input layer, 3 hidden layer, and 1 output layer

## Libraries
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
