# MNIST Neural Network
First neural network I've worked on, which has been made without libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. 

This is a pretty simple neural network with only one hidden layer.

## Description
- Neural network that identifies grey-scaled, 28 pixel x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits. 
- Using the MNIST data set for training and testing.
- Weights and biases are saved as csv files, so the model does not need to be repeatedly trained.

## General Information
- The training and testing csv files were downloaded from [[Kaggle]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) 
- Model accuracy on training data: 92.5%
- One input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer

## Libraries
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
