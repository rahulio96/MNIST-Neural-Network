# MNIST Neural Network Project

- Neural network that identifies handwritten digits.

- The training and testing csv files were downloaded from [[Kaggle]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)  

- Using the MNIST data set for training and testing.

- Weights and biases are saved as csv files, so the model does not need to be repeatedly trained.

- Model Accuracy: 92.5%
