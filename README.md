# MNIST Neural Network
A trained neural network that identifies handwritten digits. For more details on how the model works and some of the methods I incorporated, please check out the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository!

I used this trained neural network in a Flask web API as the backend for my [Digit Recognition Web App](https://github.com/rahulio96/Digit-Recognition-App) project.

## Description
- Neural network that identifies grey-scaled, 28 x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits
- Using the MNIST digit data set for training and validation
- Model accuracy on validation data is around 97%
- 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers, and 1 output layer

## Data
- The "mnist.csv" file was downloaded from Kaggle (training data): [[link]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
- MNIST images were also downloaded from Kaggle: [[link]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scolianni/mnistasjpg)

## Libraries
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
